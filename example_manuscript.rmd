abstract: |
  R is a statistical programming language which is increasingly popular with psychologists. It can import and process your data, fit statistical models (from simple t-tests to state of the art such as bayesian multilevel model fitting). It also makes nice plots. RStudio is a way of editing R scripts and running R analysis. RMarkdown is a way of using RStudio to produce documents (e.g. as webpages, MS Word or PDF). Another advantage is that you can include R code in your document file - so no more running your analysis in SPSS and copying the results into your document (and making errors / forgetting which version of the analysis you ran etc). This is an example document which integrates all the functions of Rmarkdown - running analysis, formatting references, etc. It uses an add-on for Rmarkdown called papaja which helps us make nicely APA formatted documents

# Introduction

You will find it useful to compare the output PDF document with the .rmd document. This latter item is the thing you edit to produce the PDF. 


## Example Subheading

Here are some example references in the following sentence. For reviews of this topic see @wickelgren1977speed; @heitz2014speed. Here is another example reference [e.g. @stafford2020][^p]. This paper was produced as part of the 'code club' held in the Department of Psychology at the Univetrsity of Sheffield in 2019, organised by Tom Stafford and Kat Giannadou. 

[^p]: As well as an example of a footnote.


# Method

Rmarkdown also lets us track figure labels, and updates them automatically. Look! Kittens! Illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:examplefigurename).

```{r examplefigurename, fig.cap="Example figure caption", fig.align="center", out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/kittens.jpg")
```

## Requirements

You should install R, RStudio and tex and papaja [@aust2020]. More details here https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/introduction.html#getting-started. The contributor roles are autogenerated using the Tenzing package [@holcombe2020documenting]. Read more <https://medium.com/@ceptional/announcing-tenzing-ceca6789d88c> and <https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/author-note>. Do adjust start by visting <https://martonbalazskovacs.shinyapps.io/tenzing/> or edit the yaml directly. The file tenzing.csv can be uploaded to the shinyapp to generate the contributor roles in various different formats (including the yaml we use here).


```{r}
#Once you've installed R/RStudio
#install.packages('tinytex')
#tinytex::install_tinytex()
#install.packages("devtools") 
#devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja")

#imo computational reproducibility / dependency management in R is a mess, but there we are
```

# Results

```{r asrssub, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
Hyperactivity <- c("5,6,12,13,14", "5,6")
Inattention <- c("1,2,3,4,7,8", "1,2,3,4")

df <- data.frame(Hyperactivity, Inattention)
row.names(df) <- c("ASRS-18","ASRS-6")

apa_table(
  df
  , caption = "Item grouping to subscales"
  , note = "This table was created with apa_table()."
  , escape = TRUE
  , span_text_columns = FALSE
)
```


Now let's integrate some R code to generate/import some data, run and analyse and integrate it into the document:

```{r results='hide'}
#copying from https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html
#this is some R code which evaluates when you make the document
#

#----------------Code for generating some random data

#parameters of our variables
meanA <- 100
sdA <- 15
d <- .5
sdB <- sdA
pooledSD <- sdA
meanB <- meanA + (d * pooledSD)
n1 <- 300
n2 <- 300

#create random data, put into dataframe
groupA <- rnorm(n1, meanA, sdA)
groupB <- rnorm(n2, meanB, sdB)
sub <- 1:length(n1+n2)
group <- c(rep(0,n1) ,rep(1,n2))
values <- c(groupA, groupB)
df <- data.frame(sub, group, values)

#add some missing values
index <- sample(1:(n1+n2),5)
df[index, 3] <- NA

#export to a file
write.csv(df, file = "generateddata.csv")
```

You can't see it, but in between this paragraph and the last we asked R to generate some random data and save it to a CSV file. Now we're going to import the data from the CSV file, as if it was independently created data - from an experiment or similar - and plot a graph.

```{r ourhistogram, fig.cap="Histogram of all data, grouped", fig.align="center", out.width="75%",fig.height=4}
#load data
df=read.csv("generateddata.csv")


#make histogram
#cribbing from https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/density.html
x <- df$values
x <- na.omit(x) #drop missing values
h<-hist(x, breaks=20, col="red", xlab="value")
xfit<-seq(min(x),max(x),length=40)
yfit<-dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(x),sd=sd(x))
yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(x)
lines(xfit, yfit, col="blue", lwd=2) 
```

See Figure \@ref(fig:ourhistogram). Of course we could draw all sorts of things, but this is a proof-of-concept. Finally, let's run a t-test and integrate the results into the text.

```{r}
#note that seperate code chunks remember variables from previous chunks, so we don't need to reload the data
df$group <- as.factor(df$group)
model1<-t.test(df$values ~ df$group)

p<- model1$p.value
t<- model1$statistic
df<- model1$parameter
if(p<0.05){
  word<-"a"
} else {
  word<-"no"
}
    
```

We found there was `r word` statistically significant difference between the two groups (t=`r t` (`r df`), p = `r p`). Note how the exact values in the previous sentence change every time we re-make the document (because the document also re-generates the underlying data).

Unanswered questions: Is this the best way to integrate values into text? Why is the df not an integer? What is the best way to define figure sizes so you get nice and/or consistent sizing across document formats?

Also, everyone loves tables. See Table \@ref(tab:asrssub). Currently I can't work out how to get it to appear inside a single column of the two-column "jou" output format. So it appears on the final page after the references. If you know how to solve this, get in touch please.


# Discussion

Make your document by opening .Rmd file in RStudio and clicking 'knit' 

Rmarkdown is good [@rmarkdowncite]. Need to change reference style? Change one line. Need to submit as PDF rather than .DOC? Just click 'Word' as output rather than 'PDF' (instructions here https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html). Need to change to two column style to make a nice pre-print? Again, simple - just change one line! In line 40 'class             : "man"' gives you manuscript style; "jou" gives you two column style.

To port to your own project just copy across these files:

* example_manuscript.rmd
* apa6.cls - style file which makes everything look APA format nice
* references.bib - information on references in bibtex format
* figs folder - where images integrated into the manuscript are kept


## Main conclusions

Of course, there's more effort in installing and learning and correctly marking up your document in the first place, but it is worth it.


```{r results="hide"}
#how to get a citation for packages you use
citation('papaja')
```
